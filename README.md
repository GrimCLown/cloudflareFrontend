# Project Setup Guide

## How to Get Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm i
```

## 3. Verify Wrangler Installation

Make sure that Wrangler is installed and set up properly. If it's not installed, you can install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

## 4. Configure Cloudflare

Ensure that you have a Cloudflare account set up and linked to your project.

## 5. Log in to Cloudflare

Ensure you are logged into your Cloudflare account:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

## 7. Deploy the Application

Once everything is set up, you can deploy your project by running:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Notes

Ensure that your Cloudflare Worker URL is added correctly.
If you encounter any issues with deployment, verify that your Wrangler and Cloudflare credentials are correctly configured.
That's it! Youâ€™re now ready to get your project up and running!
